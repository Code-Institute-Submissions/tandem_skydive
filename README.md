This project was made for the Fourth Milestone Project for Code Institute.
The objective is to build a full-stack site for the purpose to purchase items and a service and provide authentication mechanism to buy such things.

As such I have created a website for purchasing tandem skydives and merchandise.

[Skydive Göteborg](http://tandemhopp.se//) is a club that runs on the edge of Göteborg and provides a skydiving experience. At the moment, their website is outdated and needs a fresh look.
As such, the website needs to look new, refreshing and sells the experience of the skydive as non threathing and an experience the customer wants to enjoy. Not only the customer can purchase a skydive, but also buy film packages and merchandise to re-live the experience.


## UX ##
Skydive Göteborg is the only facility in Göteborg that offers the tandem experience. Their audience is anyone but commonly its a gift to someone else for a special occasion (birthdays, bucks and hen parties). While skydiving is sometimes referred as an extreme sport, the website wants to show the surreal beauty of the experience.
As such the website has been built for the following ideals in mind.

- The website should have a fresh modern look.
- Should explain what skydiving is.
- Give a summary on what you can expect on your day.
- Show case a film package could look like.
- Explain the difference of the film packages.
- Sell extra merchandise (shirts).
- Customer can buy the experience for another person. 

The website achieves these goals with a simple look and lets the photos to do most of the talking. It needs to sell the experience and you want to give this a go!

### Vistor to the site ###
Goals for the customer to experience while visiting the site are:
    - Admire the surreal opportunity to experience something man is not meant to do.
    - The site should make the customer safe. Explains in detail on what happens on the day.
    - Shows what the customer will experience with a example video.
    - Be encouraged to buy a film package to re-live the experience at a later date.
    - To purchase a skydive package.
    - To help support the club with extra purchase of merchandise.

### Developer Goals for the company ###
As the developer for the site, my goals are to make the site professional and help Skydive Göteborg sell the tandem packages. As such I have:
    - The site is easy to navigate.
    - Allowing the experience to be the full focus of the site.
    - Explaning any details that the customer would want to know. 
    - Ensuring payments are made correctly.


## Features ##
### Existing Features ### 
1. NavBar:
    1. Navbar should be not over powering the main page, but blends nicely into the page. The navbar colour is off from the main page which showcase the different areas while not making it to obvious.
    1. The Navbar titles are relevant for the sub-heading. All titles are obvious to where the links will take you. 
    1. The Navbar is responsive for different views.
1. Heading:
    1. The heading image, gives that sense of wonder. It clearly shows what the user is in for. A surreal experience!
    1. The company name is clear without destroying the wanting effect of the image.
    1. As the main purpose of the site, is to sell skydive packages. The Buy button is available at any point. 
1. Carousel:
    1. The carousel shows specials deals, and more information on the site.
    1. The carousel will be able to be changed with admin login. 
    1. The timing should be slow enough for the user to clearly read and click, while fast enough so that more details to be shown.   
1. Main Page:
    1. The main page background colour is a very light blue which helps it to be separted from the NavBar and also the carousel.
    1. The main page details explain what tandem skydiving is which is supported by a short film of what the customer is in for.
    1. A quick return to top button is hiden until the page low enough, to give a good user feel to the page. 
1. Your Day:
    1. Your day page should explain in more details what the customer should expect when they purchase a package.
    1. The images are to entice the customer. First image is to show case our friendly staff and the second is to make the customer go "wow!"
    1. The information is relavent to what the customer is to expect. 
        - Who can jump?
        - What happens with the weather?
        - Can family and friends come along to the airport?
        - How heigh does the plane go and how long does it take?
        - What happens if you buy a film package? 
1. Merchandise:
    1. While this is not a shop to buy clothes, the club has a limited range of clothes to sell to customers.
    1. Should show what shirts they have on sale, price and if in stock.


## Features Left to Implement ##
1. Booking service:
    - Once the customer has purchased their package. The next step is to book a date and time. As the plane has limited seats and the company changes location half way through summer. I would need to create a large booking service. As such, I had limited time and will be implemented at a later date.
    - A summary of bookings per day for for required staff.
1. Live google maps:
    - While the page has a image and a link to google map. I would like to implement a google search directly into the website.
1. Merchandise summary:
    - This would show the admin how many shirt are left in stock and when to order more. Also would show which merchandise are selling and which need to be moved.
