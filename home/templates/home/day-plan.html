        <div class="col">
            <p>If the forecast of the day does not look good, we will contact you and re-organise another day with better weather. If the weather is good, please arrive before your schudule time. The schudule time will not be the time you jump but your time
                for a briefing.
                <br>
                <br> After a safety briefing we will have our professional crew suit you up and allow time for some photos with friends and family.
                <br>
                <br> You will then meet our divers who will do a final safety check of equipment before entering the plane.
                <br>
                <br> Our PAC-750 plane will get you to the height of 14 000 feet (around 4 km high) in around 16mins. There you will enjoy the view before the jump.
                <br>
                <br> Our team would brief you in person about what to expect and experience when you first leave the plane for your skydive experience with <b class="font-blue">SKYDIVE GÃ–TEBORG!</b>
